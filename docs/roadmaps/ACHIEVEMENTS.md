# Achievements and Retention Roadmap

## Principle

Achievements should recognize behavior that improves the game: fair building, route mastery, community impact, consistent return, and exploration. They must not reward spam, deliberately lethal tiles, or low-effort submission volume.

Achievements are app-local records. Optional subreddit flair may mirror major milestones only after permission and moderation behavior are verified; do not imply they are Reddit account-level achievements.

## Launch catalog

| ID                     | Name             | Trigger                           | Purpose                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `first-certified-tile` | Roadmaker        | 1 certified tile                  | complete Builder onboarding |
| `featured-builder`     | Made the Map     | 1 selected tile                   | delayed return consequence  |
| `clean-delivery`       | Handle With Care | 1 zero-damage finish              | runner mastery              |
| `roadbook-regular`     | Roadbook Regular | 10 unique routes                  | evergreen breadth           |
| `seven-day-route`      | Seven Stops      | 7-day best streak                 | return habit                |
| `well-travelled`       | Well Travelled   | 1,000 crossings on authored tiles | persistent social impact    |
| `balanced-designer`    | Fork in the Road | 1 balanced featured tile          | meaningful route choice     |
| `world-tourist`        | World Tourist    | 5 source communities              | optional exploration        |

World Tourist remains hidden while World Tour is disabled.

## Progress events

The profile service receives authoritative events:

- `tile.certified`
- `tile.featured`
- `route.completed`
- `route.completed_clean`
- `route.unique_completed`
- `streak.updated`
- `tile.crossed`
- `tile.balance_qualified`
- `world_tour.community_completed`

Each event updates a small numeric stat and then runs the same pure unlock evaluator. Unlock writes must be idempotent.

## Streak semantics

- Dates are UTC in the scaffold for determinism.
- One completed run or one certified tile counts as daily activity.
- Repeated activity on the same date does not increment streak.
- Consecutive date increments; any larger gap resets current streak to one.
- Best streak never decreases.

Post-hackathon, tenant-configurable rollover may replace UTC. Do not mix time zones within a stored streak version.

## Presentation

### Contextual unlock

Show an achievement after the action that unlocked it:

- certification stamp after publish;
- medal/result postcard after a run;
- creator outcome card after feature/crossing threshold. First-pass Creator postcard is available from the main menu and shows featured tile crossings plus top/middle/bottom path-choice splits from current route best-run data.

### Achievement postcard

The full screen shows eight compact cards, current/target progress, category, and unlocked date. Locked World Tour entries are omitted while unavailable rather than teasing a disabled feature.

### Reddit-native recognition

Good uses:

- optional user flair for Made the Map or Well Travelled;
- weekly comment/post summary of route builders;
- creator attribution inside routes.

Bad uses:

- automatically posting every unlock;
- claiming karma or native achievement status;
- using an achievement as permission to spam comments.

## Anti-grind rules

- Republishing the same daily tile does not increment certified count.
- Crossing counts deduplicate authors per route run.
- Unique route completions use route IDs.
- Removed or invalidated runs do not count.
- A player cannot gain their own crossing impact from repeated local preview runs.
- “Balanced designer” requires a minimum sample size before path splits are evaluated.

## Future achievement families

### Skill

Gold medals, clean route streaks, all-parcel routes, no-boost challenges.

### Creation quality

Balanced choices, high clean-clear rate, several distinct featured tiles, recovery tile recognition.

### Community

Contribute to a fully human-authored route, weekly chapter completion, crossings milestones.

### Exploration

Biomes, tenant routes, seasonal chapters—only when they exist in the product.

## Acceptance criteria

- Unlock evaluation is pure, deterministic, and tested.
- The same milestone cannot unlock twice.
- A user sees why an achievement unlocked.
- No launch achievement rewards failure rate or raw repeated submissions.
- Hidden/disabled mechanics do not appear as impossible requirements.
