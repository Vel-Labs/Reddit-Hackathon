## Calendar Gates

- Submission period: June 17, 2026 at 12:00 pm PT through July 15, 2026 at 6:00 pm PT.
- Feedback period: same window as the submission period.
- Judging period: July 16, 2026 at 12:00 am PT through July 27, 2026 at 6:00 pm PT.
- Winners expected around July 29, 2026 at 3:00 pm PT.
- Freeze rule: after the submission deadline, do not assume Devpost submission materials can be materially changed except for organizer-approved fixes such as rights, privacy, or inappropriate-material corrections.

## Eligibility and Entry Gates

- Entrant must satisfy the official eligibility rules and appoint a representative if entering as a team or organization.
- Register on the Devpost hackathon page before submission.
- Sign up for Reddit Developer Platform access at `developers.reddit.com`.
- Submit through Devpost during the submission period.
- Keep the project free to test, evaluate, and use through the judging period.
- Do not rely on any financial, commercial, or preferential support from Reddit/Sponsor that would create a real or apparent conflict under the official rules.

## Required Project Shape

- Build a game for Reddit communities using Reddit's Developer Platform.
- Daily Dash must remain a Devvit Web app: client webview plus Devvit server/runtime configuration in `devvit.json`.
- Daily Dash should stay in the community game lane: shared play, collaboration, competition, community-authored outcomes, and recurring reasons to return.
- The app must run consistently on its intended platform and match the submitted text/video description.
- If the project existed before the submission period, the submission must explain the significant updates made during the submission period.
- The submitted app must not be a prior Reddit hackathon winner.

## Submission Package Checklist

- Devpost text description explaining features and functionality.
- Unique app listing link in the form `https://developers.reddit.com/apps/{app-name}`.
- Detailed root `README.md` describing the game and how to play.
- Demo post link containing both the test subreddit and a Reddit post running the game.
- Public demo subreddit with fewer than 200 members, or a valid admin-access path if using Reddit's documented admin-approve app.
- Optional public repository URL.
- Optional demo video under one minute, publicly visible on an approved video host, showing the app functioning on its target device.
- Optional Developer Platform feedback survey if pursuing the feedback prize.
- English-language submission materials, or English translations for all submitted materials.

## Rights, Assets, and Privacy

- Use only code, art, audio, video, text, and other materials the entrant owns or is licensed/authorized to use.
- Record third-party asset provenance and license terms before importing assets.
- Do not import unreviewed asset archives into the client bundle.
- Do not include third-party marks, personal information, or inappropriate material in submission assets or demo media.
- Keep free-text, uploads, and arbitrary user drawings out of Builder scope unless a moderation redesign and rule review happen first.
- Do not add payments, premium features, or external services without separate Devvit Rules review and explicit scope approval.

## Devvit Rules and Platform Gates

- Review Devvit Rules before public submission and before any publish/app-review attempt.
- Expect Reddit app review before public app directory availability.
- Playtest thoroughly before review.
- Keep client, server, and shared boundaries intact:
  - `src/client`: webview/Phaser UI only.
  - `src/server`: Devvit server context, Reddit APIs, Redis, Hono endpoints.
  - `src/shared`: pure deterministic gameplay logic.
- Server must not trust client-provided identity, tenant, status, score, metrics, or publication identity.
- Server must rerun tile certification for published tiles.
- Keep Redis tenant-local per subreddit installation; do not fake cross-subreddit global storage through shared Redis keys.
- Do not use legacy Blocks or `@devvit/public-api` patterns in this Devvit Web app.

## Judging Alignment

- Baseline viability: Daily Dash must fit the hackathon theme and use the required Reddit Developer Platform APIs/SDKs.
- Delightful UX: first-time players should discover Builder and Runner without external docs.
- Polish: submitted demo posts should be close to launch quality and compliant with Devvit Rules.
- Reddity: emphasize subreddit community authorship, creator impact, and recurring community routes.
- Hook: daily certified tiles, scheduled route compilation, evergreen Roadbook, leaderboards, streaks, and creator crossings should create return reasons.
- Phaser category: use Phaser meaningfully for the Builder, Runner, route visualization, input, animation, and polish.
- Retention category: daily routes, Roadbook history, streaks, leaderboards, achievements, and visible creator outcomes are the relevant mechanics.
- User contribution category: certified community-authored tiles are the core user-generated gameplay surface.

## Local Stop Rules

- Do not submit or claim live readiness until a public test subreddit and post running the game are verified.
- Do not claim Devvit app listing readiness until a unique app slug exists and upload creates the app link.
- Do not claim asset readiness until third-party licenses are recorded.
- Do not claim public moderation readiness until report/removal and route repair behavior are verified or explicitly disclosed as a limitation.
- Do not add World Tour, payments, external shared services, jumping, free-text Builder input, uploads, or arbitrary drawing as hackathon MVP dependencies.
- If Devvit Rules, Developer Platform docs, or official hackathon rules change, update this document and the submission checklist before continuing implementation.
